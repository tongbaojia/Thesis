\section{Boosted signal region}
\paragraph{}
The unblinded results are summarised in Table ~\ref{tab:sr-summary}. 

\paragraph{}
For reader's interest, we integrate the background prediction from a certain mass point on and compare that with our unblinded observations. These are listed in Table ~\ref{tab:sr-region-4b}, ~\ref{tab:sr-region-3b}, ~\ref{tab:sr-region-2b}. The unscaled $2bs$/$3b$/$4b$s dijet mass distributions are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:boosted-2b-signal-l}, \ref{fig:boosted-3b-signal-l}, \ref{fig:boosted-4b-signal-l}. No significant excess of number of events or in the dijet mass distribution is observed.

\paragraph{}
For the scaled dijet mass, the integral values are listed in Table ~\ref{tab:sr-region-4b-pole}, ~\ref{tab:sr-region-3b-pole}, ~\ref{tab:sr-region-2b-pole}. The scaled $2bs$/$3b$/$4b$s dijet mass distributions are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:boosted-2b-signal-pole}, \ref{fig:boosted-3b-signal-pole}, \ref{fig:boosted-4b-signal-pole}. No significant excess of number of events or in the dijet mass distribution is observed as well.

\paragraph{}
Other distributions in signal region are shown in Appendix~\ref{AppendixSR}.

\paragraph{}
Here the results are displayed for the mass range that includes the boosted categories (ie. 800 GeV and above).  In the range 800-1400 GeV the boosted categories are combined with the resolved categories. The full mass range results are collected in the resolved note.

\paragraph{}
A search for statistically significant deviation from the background model hypothesis is performed following the procedure described in Sec.\,\ref{sec-search-procedure}, computing the local $p_0$ value using the asymptotic approximation.

\paragraph{}
The background model is found to describe the data and no significant excess is observed. The smallest local $p_0=0.175$ (1$\sigma$) is found at 1100 GeV when fitting with the narrow scalar model. The local $p_0$ values for the three signal models as a function of the resonance mass are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:localp0}.

\section{Resolved signal region}
\paragraph{}
The number of events observed in the data, the predicted number of background events in the signal region, and the predicted yield for three potential signals are presented in Table~\ref{tab:resolvedResults} for both the 2015 and 2016 datasets. The numbers of observed and predicted events in the control region are also given, and they are in agreement. A discrepancy between data and the total prediction is seen in the 2016 dataset; about half of this excess can be attributed to one bin at $\mfourj=280$~\GeV.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\caption{The number of predicted background events in the signal region (SR) for the resolved analysis compared to the data, for the 2015 and 2016 datasets. The yields for three potential signals, an 800~\GeV\ \Grav resonance with \kMPl = 1, a scalar with a mass of 280~\GeV, and SM non-resonant Higgs boson pair production, are also shown. The scalar sample is normalized to a cross section times branching ratio of 2.7~pb. The quoted uncertainties include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and the total uncertainty considers correlations. The numbers of observed and predicted events are also given in the control region (CR).}

Figure~\ref{fig:resolvedHHUnblinded} shows comparisons of the predicted \mfourj~background distributions to those observed in the 2015 and 2016 datasets. A few signal models are also displayed. The scalar sample shown is normalized to a cross section times \hbb\ branching ratio of 2.7~pb, which is the best-fit value (the fit is described in Section~\ref{sec:statAna}). The predicted background and observed distributions are mostly in agreement, with an excess above the predicted background in one bin around 280~\GeV, which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:statAna}.

\section{Observed Limits}
\label{sec:observedlimits}

\paragraph{}
The observed limit for the narrow scalar is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_scalar}. The stat-only limit is also shown. The impact of systematic uncertainties is small. The observed limits for the Graviton models is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_g10} for c=1 and in Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_g20} for c=2. These limits do not contain any of the resolved categories.

\label{fig:limit_scalar}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:nuisanceParams} shows the pulls of the systematic uncertainty nuisance parameters and their correlations for the 2000 GeV mass point. One nuisance parameter (QCD\_ShapeCRHigh) in both the $2b$ and $3b$ samples shows a significant constraint coming from the signal region data. This nuisance parameter corresponds to the shape uncertainty on the QCD background derived from the $2b$ and $3b$ control regions, as explained in Section \ref{unc-shape-qcd-in-sr}. The prior probability distributions for this nuisance parameter is very broad, with the relative uncertainty on the background prediction reaching 15000\% at high $m_{hh}$. This is because there is very little data in the control region at high mass to constrain the uncertainty. In the signal region however, the two events found suffice to constrain it: very tightly in comparison to the extremely loose prior constraint.

\caption{Nuisance parameters associated with the background modelling, after the conditional likelihood fit for a bulk RS graviton signal with $\mGrav=2\,\TeV$ and $\kMPl=1.0$. The tight constraints of 2b\_QCD\_CRShape and 3b\_QCD\_CRShape are a result of the nuisance parameter prior being unconstrained due to a lack of control region data at high mass.}
\label{fig:nuisanceParams}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Examples of the fit used to set these limits are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:postfit2000} and~\ref{fig:postfit2500}, where a narrow scalar is used for the signal model. In the case the best-fit is negative, the fit is repeated with mu bounded to zero. This happens at several mass points, for example at 1.5, 2.5 and 3 TeV. At 2~TeV, the fitted signal is positive ($\mu=0.1\pm0.25$) though well consistent with the background-only hypothesis. In all fits, good agreement is seen between data and the background model.
