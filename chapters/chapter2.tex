\chapter{LHC and ATLAS}
\paragraph{}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a proton-proton ($pp$) collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland~\cite{LHCPaper}.  ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS), CMS (the Compact Muon Solenoid), ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), and LHC$b$ (Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment) ~\cite{ATLASPaper, CMSPaper, LHCbPaper, ALICEPaper} are the four main experiments. They are located at the Interaction points(IPs) of the accelerator. Figure~\ref{fig:LHC} shows a schematic of the LHC ring and its experiments.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{sec:LHC}
\paragraph{}
Protons accelerated around the LHC originate in a red bottle of hydrogen gas. 
The whole acceleration, taking around 25 minutes, is accomplished in multiple steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Electrons are stripped from the hydrogens to create protons;
\item A linear particle accelerator, Linac 2, accelerates the protons to $50$ \MeV; 
\item The Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) accelerates the protons to $1.4$ \GeV;
\item The Proton Synchrotron (PS) accelerates the protons to $25$ \GeV; 
\item The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerates the protons to $450$ \GeV;
\item The $16.7$ kilometers LHC accelerates the protons to the final \TeV~ energies. 
%The LHC uses 1232 Niobium Titanium magnetic dipole for steering the protons. The magnets are cooled by superfluid helium to $1.9$ Kelvin, and can generate $8.33$ Tesla magnetic field.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
The instantaneous luminosity, $L$ ($m^{-2}s^{-1}$), at the LHC is defined in Eq\ref{Ch2:eq-lumi} ~\cite{LHCReview}:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{Ch2:eq-lumi}
L = \frac{n_b N_b^2 f_{\rm rev} \gamma_r}{4\pi \epsilon_n \beta^*} F
\end{equation}
%
In the above Eq\ref{Ch2:eq-lumi}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $n_b$ is the number of bunches per beam; %$n_b$ cannot be too large due to potential beam loss damages on the accelerator and detector; %Nominally, $2808$ proton bunches.
	\item $N_b$ is the number of protons per bunch;  
	\item $f_{\rm rev}$ is the proton revolution frequency;
	\item $\gamma_r$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor for the protons;
	\item $\epsilon_n$ is the normalized transverse beam emittance, or the average beam spread length;
	\item $\beta^*$ is the transverse beam size; $\sigma_{\rm beam} = \sqrt{\epsilon \cdot \beta}$; %affected by focusing magnets;
	\item $F$ is a reduction factor for the angle beams are colliding. %; smaller crossing angles could cause larger spread in the longitudinal direction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{} 
In $pp$ collisions, the rate of a certain physics process is $R_{\rm phy} = L\sigma$, where $\sigma$ ($m^2$) the cross section.
The instantaneous luminosity can also be written as the ratio of the rate of inelastic collisions to the inelastic cross section $\sigma_{\rm inel}$ ~\cite{lumi-paper}:
\begin{equation}
\label{Ch2:eq-lumi2}
L = \frac{R_{\rm inel}}{\sigma_{\rm inel}} = \frac{\mu n_b f_{\rm rev}}{\sigma_{\rm inel}}
\end{equation}
where, $\mu$ is the number of interactions per bunch crossing. 
At each bunch crossing, the collisions without the highest center of mass energy are called ``pileup" interactions.

\paragraph{}
The main parameters of the LHC beam and performance are shown in Table~\ref{Ch2:tab-lhc}. 
The target peak instantaneous luminosity for both the ATLAS and CMS experiments is $L=10^{34}~\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$~\cite{LHCPaper}, which has already been exceeded in 2016. 
This is partly due to the improved $\beta^*$ and $F$.
The number of ``pileup" interactions also increases, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Mu_2015_2016}.

%At the nominal LHC conditions, the beam energy is about 360 MegaJoules, and the LHC in total consumes 115 MegaWatt of power.


\section{A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS}
\label{sec:ATLAS}

\paragraph{}
The ATLAS experiment~\cite{PERF-2007-01} at the LHC is a general-purpose particle detector with a near $4\pi$ coverage in solid angle and a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry. 
The ATLAS detector (Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS}) consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a $2.3$ m diameter thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS). Three extra air-core toroid magnets generate the magnetic field in the MS. 
%with $1.5$ to $5.5 ~\textrm{T} \cdot\textrm{m}$ of bending power at $0<|\eta|<1.4$ and approximately $1$ to $7.5 ~\textrm{T} \cdot\textrm{m}$ in the endcap region of $1.6 < |\eta| < 2.7$.

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Coordinate System}
\label{sec:ATLAS-coord}
\paragraph{}
ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal IP in the center of the detector and the $z$-axis along the beam pipe.
The positive $x$-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, the positive $y$-axis points towards the sky, and the $z$-axis points straight(like bridges) towards the Geneva airport(A side), back from the Charlie's pub in France(C side).
Cylindrical coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$ being the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis.
The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as $\eta = -\ln \tan(\theta/2)$. $\eta$ the massless approximation of rapidity $y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{E + p_{z}}{E - p_{z}}$.
$\theta$ is the angle parameterizing special relativity's boosts along the $z$-axis. 
%Most hadron productions are roughly constant in $\eta$, and for two massless particles traveling in different directions, their difference in $\Delta \eta$ is invariant. 
The angular distance is measured in units of $\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2} + (\Delta\phi)^{2}}$.

\paragraph{}
The region with $|\eta| < 1.5$ is called ``central". It consists of the ``barrel" elements, surrounding the beam line cylindrically. For $|\eta| > 1.5$, the region is called ``endcap", and the detector elements are arranged as disks perpendicular to the beam line. At high $|\eta| > 2.5$, the region is referred to as ``forward".

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Inner Detector}
\paragraph{}
The ID covers the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 2.5$.
It consists of three parts: silicon pixel (PIXEL), silicon microstrip (SCT), and straw-tube transition-radiation tracking (TRT) detectors. 
An additional pixel detector layer (IBL) ~\cite{Capeans:1291633}, positioned at a mean radius of $3.3$ cm, is used in the Run-2 data-taking and improves the identification of $b$-jets~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-022}. 
A $10$\GeV~ charged particle in the barrel region expect $1$ IBL hits, $3$ PIXEL hits, $8$ SCT hits and $36$ TRT hits.
Figure~\ref{fig:Det_ID_rz} ~\cite{Aaboud:2017pjd} shows the $R$-$z$ distribution of the material for a quadrant of the barrel region PIXEL and SCT. 
Figure~\ref{fig:Det_ID_xy} shows the distribution of hadronic-interaction vertex candidates in $|\eta|<2.4$ and $|z|<400$ mm for $13$\TeV~ data.
The ID is important for track reconstruction and heavy flavor $b$-tagging. 

%\paragraph{}
%The ID is designed to provide charged particle momentum measurement with $\sigma_{p_{T}}/p_{T} \sim 0.05\% p_{T} \oplus 1\%$ and vertex reconstruction.
%Because of this, each detector proves measurement accuracies of the order $10 \mu\rm m$ in $R$-$\phi$ and $100 \mu\rm m$ in $z$.
%The intensity of a particle beam decreases exponentially in radiation length. $I(x) = I_0 e^{-x/X_0}$, where $I$ is the intensity, $x$ is the distance traveled, and $X_0$ is the radiation length.

\subsection{Calorimeter}
\paragraph{}
The Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) finely segmented sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements. 
A steel/scintillator-tile hadronic calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range ($|\eta| < 1.7$).
The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with copper/tungsten and LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to $|\eta| = 4.9$. The calorimeters also provide basic EM/Hadronic trigger information, with fast analogue summing in coarse granularity.
The calorimeters are important for measuring the energy of the Higgs boson decay productions.

%\paragraph{}
%EM calorimeter (ECal) is designed to have $>22$ radiation lengths in the barrel and $> 24$ in the endcap. 
%It provides EM measurement with $\sigma_E/E = 10\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus 0.7\%$. The hadronic calorimeter (HCal) has approximately $9.7$ interaction length in the barrel and $10$ in the endcap. 
%HCal provides hadronic measurement with $\sigma_E/E = 50\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus 3\%$ in the Barrel and Endcap regions, and $\sigma_E/E = 100\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus 10\%$  in the forward region.

    \end{subfigure}
\caption{The overall layout of the ATLAS MuonSpectrometer.}
\label{fig:Det_MS}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
The muon spectrometer (Figure~\ref{fig:Det_MS}) is the largest component of the ATLAS detector.
It surrounds the calorimeters and includes three large superconducting air-core toroids. 
The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2 and 6 T/m for most of the detector. Because of this bending power, the MS measures Muon momentum stand-alone, with $\sigma_{p_{T}}/p_{T} \sim 10\%$ at $p_{T} = 1$\TeV. 
Muon Drift Tubes (MDT) and Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) provide precision tracking. 
%Each MDT has $80\,\mu\textrm{m}$ single hit spacial resolution, with an alignment precision of $30\,\mu\textrm{m}$.
Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) in the barrel and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) provide triggering, with $1.5$-$5$ ns timing resolution. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Trigger and Data Acquisition}
\paragraph{}
A dedicated trigger system is used to select events~\cite{ATLAS-TRIGGER}.
The first-level trigger (L$1$) is implemented in hardware and uses the calorimeter and muon detectors to seed regions of interest (RoI) and reduce the accepted event rate to $100$ kHZ.
This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger (HLT) that reduces the accepted event rate to $1$ kHZ on average. 
To avoid high rates for certain triggers, the triggers are often prescaled, which means some accepted events get rejected. 
For example, a prescale of two means only every second event passing all trigger conditions gets accepted. 

\paragraph{}
Over 2015 and 2016, both the LHC and the ATLAS performed outstandingly ~\cite{Lumi_Run2}. The total data recording efficiency for ATLAS is around $92\%$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Lumi}.
