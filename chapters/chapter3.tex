\chapter{Eyes of giant--The ATLAS Detector}

We love ATLAS. It even has a writting style \href{guide}{https://cds.cern.ch/record/1110290}.

\section{Inner Detector}
\paragraph{}
Material of ATLAS Inner Detector for Run 2 of the LHC. \href{https://cds.cern.ch/record/2260595/files/PERF-2015-07-002.pdf}{note}.


\section{Trigger and Data Aquasition}
\paragraph{}
To avoid too high accept rates for certain triggers, the triggers are often prescaled, which means the accepted events get rejected at the prescale. For example, a prescale of two means only every second event passing all trigger conditions gets accepted.

For trigger information, see \href{http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/TRIG-2016-01/}{2015 note} and \href{https://cds.cern.ch/record/2242069/files/ATL-DAQ-PUB-2017-001.pdf}{2016 updates}.
