w\paragraph{}
A statistical uncertainty on the value of \muqcd for the $4b$ ($3b$, 2$b$s) Signal Region was determined from the fitting procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:ttbarnorm}. 
%where \muqcd = $0.00084\pm 0.000072$ (stat) in the 4 $b$-tag region, \muqcd = $0.00838 \pm 0.00017$ (stat) in the 3 $b$-tag region, and \muqcd = $0.036 \pm 0.00037$ (stat) in the 2 $b$s-tag region.

\paragraph{}
The statistical uncertainty of the \ttbar\ normalization is accounted for through the uncertainties on \alphatt from the fit to data, as described in Section~\ref{sec:ttbarnorm}. The statistical uncertainty of 69\% on \alphatt are 79\% anti-correlated to the value of \muqcd found in the fitting procedure in the 4 $b$-tag region, the uncertainties of 9\% on \alphatt are 76\% anti-correlated to the value of \muqcd found in the fitting procedure in the 3 $b$-tag region, and the uncertainties of 2.6\% on \alphatt are 75\% anti-correlated to the value of \muqcd found in the fitting procedure in the 2$b$s-tag region.

\paragraph{}
The background systematic uncertainties in the signal region are divided into the following components:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Non-closure uncertainty on \muqcd found by comparing the value derived from the sideband to the control region normalization.
 \item Effects on the QCD prediction from variations of the SideBand and Control Region Definitions
 \item The impact of the shape uncertainty of the \ttbar\ distribution in the $4b$ signal region.
 \item The impact of the shape uncertainty of the 1/2$b$ QCD distribution derived in the control region.
 \item The impact of the smoothing function fit range and function choice on the QCD prediction
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
The \ttbar\ normalization uncertainty on \alphatt is derived in the fit to data as described in Section~\ref{sec:ttbarnorm}. This has a negligible impact on the signal sensitivity, but is still propagated as the uncertainty in the \ttbar\ normalization in the signal region.

%However, the \ttbar\ background estimation can impact the value of $\mu_{QCD}$ used to determine the QCD normalization in the signal region, where a 53\% (60\%) correlation was found in the fitting procedure between \muqcd and \alphatt in the 4 (3) $b$-tag region This and the other background uncertainty components will be discussed in this section. 

\subsubsection{Non-closure uncertainty on \muqcd determined in the control region}
\label{sec:non-closure-mu-qcd}

\paragraph{}
A further uncertainty is derived by comparing the value of \muqcd to the overall difference between predicted to observed events in the control region. While the total predicted background (showing stat error only) of 4$b$: 76.7 $\pm$ 5.4 vs obs 81.0, 3$b$: 1565.6 $\pm$ 18.1 vs obs 1553.0, 2$b$s: 8332.4 $\pm$ 38.8 vs obs 8486.0, the number events agrees with the total data in the control region within statistical error, we consider an added systematic on the background prediction normalization, taken a as the maximum between either the difference between the central value of the prediction to the observed number of events (4.3 events, or 5\%, for 4$b$.  13 events, or 1\%, for 3$b$; 154 events, or 2\%, for 2$b$s) or the statistical uncertainty of the observed 4b (3b) data in the CR (11.1\% for $4b$; 2.5\% for $3b$; and 1.1\% for 2$b$s). For the detailed numbers, please refer to section ~\ref{sec:yields}. 

\paragraph{}
Although we have derived our non-closure uncertainty on $\mu_{QCD}$ from comparison between data and prediction in the control region, we need to test how this number is sensitive to our choice of control region (CR) and sideband region (SB). In addition, we also want to check how our background prediction in signal region is sensitive to the choice of control region and sideband region. All these tests are done on the control/sideband regions after the full reweighting procedure as described in \ref{sec:boosted-reweight}, while applying the nominal reweighting values.

\paragraph{}
Besides the nominal control region as described above, we design three additional control regions, as illustrated in Figure \ref{CRSB:CR_High}, \ref{CRSB:CR_Low}, \ref{CRSB:CR_Small}, \ref{CRSB:SB_High}, \ref{CRSB:SB_Low}, \ref{CRSB:SB_Large}, \ref{CRSB:SB_Small}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low-mass CR: the center position of the circle that defines nominal CR is moved down by 3 GeV, in both leading and sub-leading large-jet mass.
	\item High-mass CR: the center position of the circle that defines nominal CR is moved up by 3 GeV, in both leading and sub-leading large-R jet mass.
	\item Signal-depletion (Small) CR: the $X_{hh}$ cut that defines signal region is increased to $2.0$ from $1.6$. This variation only affect CR, while SR remains unchanged (i.e. signal region is still defined by $X_{hh}<1.6$, while CR is defined as $X_{hh}>2.0$ and $R_{hh}<33$).
	\item High-mass SB: The signal region and control region remain unchanged, the center position of the circle that defines nominal SB is moved up by 3 GeV in both leading and sub-leading large-R jet mass.
	\item Low-mass SB: The signal region and control region remain unchanged, the center position of the circle that defines nominal SB is moved up by 3 GeV in both leading and sub-leading large-R jet mass.
	\item Large SB: The signal region and control region remain unchanged, while the SB is $33 < R_{hh}$ and $ R_{hh}^{\text{high}} < 61$. $\mu_{QCD}$ will change.
	\item Small SB: The signal region and control region remain unchanged, while the SB is $33 < R_{hh}$ and $ R_{hh}^{\text{high}} < 55$. $\mu_{QCD}$ will change.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
%To ensure that these value cover the QCD normalization uncertainty, further checks on the effect of adjusting the Control and Sideband definitions were done. 
The results are summarized in Table \ref{CRSB:Tab_4b_CR_Variations}, \ref{CRSB:Tab_3b_CR_Variations} and \ref{CRSB:Tab_2bs_CR_Variations}, while the details are presented in the Appendix~\ref{app:boosted-syst-CRSB_Definition_Variation}. Based on all the variations, a 2.8\% normalization uncertainty is assigned to 2$b$s region, 4.2\% to 3$b$ region (which is the statistical uncertainty), and a 12.2\% normalization uncertainty is assigned to 4$b$ region.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty on the shape of the \ttbar\ jet mass in the $4/3b$ signal region}
\label{sec:unc-shape-ttbar-in-sr}

%In a similar method as stated in the previous section, the shape uncertainty of the signal region dijet mass in \ttbar\ events due to b-tagging or c-rejection is conservatively estimated by comparing the 0b, 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b distributions to the nominal 3b/4b shapes. Figure~\ref{ttbar-shapes-signal} shows the \ttbar\ leading jet and dijet mass distributions in the signal region, all normalized to the predicted number of events in the signal region from the simultaneous fit for \alphatt\ in the sideband.  
%All shapes are comparable within statistical uncertainties.  The difference in shape between the 2b and 3b distributions is taken as the \ttbar\ shape systematic in the signal region.  These shapes are further validated in data in a \ttbar-enriched region, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:boosted-ttbar}.

\paragraph{}
Because the 4/3$b$ \ttbar\ MJJ distribution is extremely statistically limited, the 4/3$b$ shape is used to predict the final \ttbar\ background shape in the $2bs$ signal region. In order to estimate the possible shape uncertainty, the $2b$s and $3b$ sideband shapes are compared in Figure~\ref{fig:ttbar-shapes-signal} (after being normalized to the same area).  The $2b$s is used as there are not sufficient $4b$ statistics to asses the comparison quality. In order to avoid large statistical uncertainties, the distributions of the $3b$ and $2b$ are smoothed. The ratio of the two smoothed distributions is taken as the shape systematic. We then use this function to apply a bin-by-bin scaling of the \ttbar\ background prediction in the signal region, maintaining the same normalization given by nominal $t\bar{t}$ normalization prediction.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty on the shape of the $1/2b$ QCD distribution in the signal region}
\label{unc-shape-qcd-in-sr}

\paragraph{}
As shown in Figures~\ref{fig:boosted-4b-control-ak10-system} and~\ref{fig:boosted-3b-control-ak10-system}, the shape distribution of the total predicted background using the scaled $1/2b$ QCD sample was found to be in good agreement with the 4$b$, 3$b$, and 2$b$s data in the control region.  However due to the low statistics in the data in the control region, the comparison is performed by first smoothing the $1/2b$, and the $4/3/2bs$ distributions. The ratio of the smoothed $1/2b$ distributions to that of the smoothed $4/3/2bs$ distributions is taken as the shape systematic. This function is then used to apply a bin-by-bin scaling of the QCD background prediction in the signal region, maintaining the same normalization given by \muqcd.  The CR distributions and the smoothing fit ratios can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:qcd_shape_fit}. This systematics is further split into two parts: one below 2000 \GeV and the other above 2000 \GeV, to ensure the low and high mass shape variation post-fit pulls can vary independently. It should be noted, that this uncertainty is used for both the dijet mass, and the scaled dijet mass distribution, and the correction to to scaling is expected to be small relative to the dijet mass.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty on QCD smoothing function in the signal region}
\label{unc-smooth-qcd-in-sr}

\paragraph{}
The MJ8 function has been used to fit the QCD background prediction in order to smooth the distribution and provide non-zero background estimates up to dijet masses beyond which we have $1/2b$ statistics.  While this distribution is  observed to fit the $1/2b$ data well, it does not have a concrete physical motivation, and in principle the high mass tail of the distribution could be larger than predicted by an exponential.  Two checks are performed, changing the boundaries where the fit is performed, and changing the fit function.

\paragraph{}
To test the impact of the region in which the fit is performed, we varied the upper bound on the dijet fit region to be each of the values $\{2800,\ 3000,\ 3200\}$ GeV and the starting value between $\{1200,\ 1300,\ 1400\}$ GeV.  The ratio of the fits for each upper bound, to that of the nominal (1200-3000 GeV) can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:qcd_fit_range_sys_ratio-scaled}, along with a hash band showing the statistical uncertainty of the nominal fit.  The maximum deviation from the nominal fit, per bin, is taken as the shape systematic uncertainy.  This is estimated separately for 2$b$s, 3$b$, and 4$b$ samples.

\paragraph{}
It should be noted that fits in which the fit $\chi^2$ probability was less than 0.001\%, or in which the fit integrals between 1500-2000 GeV, 2000-2500 GeV, or $>$2500 GeV were not in agreement with the original $1/2b$ distribution within a factor of 2 or 0.5, were not used to estimate the uncertainty.  The aforementioned checks ensure that we do not use poor fits of the $1/2b$ distribution to estimate the uncertainty.

%As we can see, changing the fit upper bound does not change the high mass tail prediction by large amounts, and is well within the statistical uncertainty of the nominal fit.  As a result, no additional systematic uncertainty is assigned for this fit range variation.
