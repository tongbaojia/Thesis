\paragraph{}
All backgrounds are data-driven, with the exception of $Z$+jets, which is very small. The \ttbar\ simulation is only used to determine the shape of expected events, where the \ttbar\ normalization is derived in data. MC uncertainties are applied to all simulated samples and propagated anywhere a MC based shape is used.
