%%\paragraph{}
The event yield results showing the estimated backgrounds, the signal predictions, and the data observations in the $4b$ and $3b$ and $2b$ signal regions (blinded), control regions, and sideband regions can be found in Table~\ref{tab:yields4b} and Table~\ref{tab:yields3b} and Table~\ref{tab:yields2b} respectively. Total background statistical uncertainty is less than the quaratic sum of \ttbar and QCD because of the anti-correlation.

\caption{Expected yields for backgrounds in the $4b$ signal region, control region, and sideband region, along with the observed number of data events.  The signal predictions for RS $m=1.0, 1.5, 2.0$~\TeV\ of both $c=1.0$ and $c=2.0$, and for narrow width heavy Higgs of $m=1.0, 1.5, 2.0$~\TeV\ are also listed.  For each predicted value, the uncertainty listed is statistical, without fit uncertainty.}
