%%\paragraph{}
Table~\ref{boosted-cutflow} shows the cutflow numbers in data, two different graviton signal MC mass points, $t\bar{t}$ MC samples and $Z+$jets MC samples. The selection efficiency at various stages for RS graviton (RSG) $c=1.0$ (narrow width scalar resonance) signal samples of all mass points can be found in Table~\ref{boosted-eff-RSG_c10}, ~\ref{boosted-eff-RSG_c20} and ~\ref{boosted-eff-2HDM}. Here Sideband indicates the Sideband region as defined before in Equation~\ref{eq:boosted_RhhhighDef}, which is not the whole region outside Control and Signal region.
