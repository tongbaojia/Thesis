\section{The Standard Model and the Higgs Boson}
\paragraph{}
The Standard Model(SM) ~\cite{Pdg,Griffiths,Tully,Schwartz} is a quantum field theory describing the interactions of fundamental particles through the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces. The elementary particles are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SM}. So far, the SM predictions of particle interactions agree extremely well with experimental observations.

  \label{fig:SM}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
%However, in SM, due to the gauge invriance under $SU(2)_{L}$, fermions have to be massless in order to have pure left handed states. 
%The bosons must also be massless as required by the gauge principle. 
In the SM, the Higgs mechanism introduces a complex scalar Higgs field, $\phi$, with nonzero vacuum expectation values. The scalar Higgs potential is $V(\phi) = -\nu^2\lambda_{\rm \nu} \phi^{\dagger}\phi + \lambda_{\rm \nu}(\phi^\dagger\phi)^2$. Through spontaneous symmetry breaking, $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons acquire their masses.  This process also predicts an extra scalar, the Higgs boson. The SM Lagrangian containing Higgs couplings, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm Higgs}$, is shown in Eq~\ref{eqn:higgspotential}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:higgspotential}
% V(\phi_{h}) = \lambda \nu^2 \phi_{h} ^2  + \lambda \nu \phi_{h} ^3  + \frac{1}{4}\lambda \phi_{h} ^4 
\mathcal{L}_{\rm Higgs} = -\lambda_{hf\bar{f}} hf\bar{f} + \delta_{V} V_{\rm\mu} V^{\rm\mu}\left(\lambda_{\rm hVV} h + \lambda_{\rm hhVV}h^2\right) + \lambda_{\rm hh}h^2 + \lambda_{\rm hhh}h^3 + \lambda_{\rm hhhh}h^4 
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\rm\nu \sim 246$ \GeV, is the non-zero expectation value of the Higgs field;\
	\item $\lambda_{\rm \nu} \sim -0.13$, the coefficient for the quartic potential term, is constrained from Higgs mass;
  \item $m_{\rm h} = \sqrt{2\lambda_{\rm \nu}}\nu = 125.09 \pm 0.24$ \GeV, is the Higgs mass; this was discovered in 2012\cite{ATLASHiggsDisc, CMSHiggsDisc}; 
	\item $V = W^{\pm}$ or $Z$, $\delta_{W} = 1$, $\delta_{Z} = \frac{1}{2}$;
	\item $\lambda_{hf\bar{f}} = \frac{m_{\rm f}}{\rm\nu}$, is the Higgs to fermion coupling; $m_{\rm f}$ is the mass of the fermion;
	\item $\lambda_{\rm hVV} = \frac{2m_{\rm V}^2}{\rm\nu}$, is the Higgs to boson coupling; $m_{\rm V}$ is the mass of the boson;
	\item $\lambda_{\rm hhVV} = \frac{m_{\rm V}^2}{\rm\nu^2}$, is the Higgs-Higgs to boson-boson coupling;
	\item $\lambda_{\rm hh} = \frac{m_{\rm h}^2}{2}$, is the Higgs mass term;
	\item $\lambda_{\rm hhh} = \frac{m_{\rm h}^2}{2\rm\nu} = \lambda_{\rm \nu} \nu$, or $\lambda_{\rm hhh}$, is the Higgs self-coupling;
	\item $\lambda_{\rm hhhh} = \frac{m_{\rm h}^2}{8\rm\nu^2}$, is the Higgs quartic-coupling.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
What's particularly interesting and has not been measured experimentally is $\lambda_{\rm hhh}$. 
The SM predicts $\lambda_{\rm hhh} = \frac{m_{\rm h}^2}{2\rm\nu}$, which is referred as \textbf{$\lambda_{\rm SM}$} in this thesis. 
Measuring $\lambda_{\rm hhh}$ directly probes the Higgs potential.
%A different coupling from $\lambda_{\rm SM}$ is usually referred as just $\lambda$. 
Also, the $\lambda_{\rm hhh}h^3$ term shows one way for double Higgs production within the SM. Double Higgs production is also known as \textit{di-Higgs} or \textit{Higgs pair production}.

%Di-Higgs final states will provide complementary information from single Higgs physics at the LHC.
%Measuring this coefficient is one of the major tasks of experimental particle physics program.

\section{Standard Model di-Higgs production}

%   \label{fig:SM_HH}
% \end{figure}

% \paragraph{}
% In the SM, the Higgs boson pair production through the $\lambda_{\rm hhh}$ has an on-shell component and a large off-shell component. The on-shell is strongly disfavored, requiring two off-shell Higgs bosons in the final state. The sensitivity region to the trilinear coupling production as in ~\ref{fig:SM_HH_tri}, is mainly in the kinematic region where the two Higgs boson in the final state are on-shell and the Higgs boson acts as a propagator (off-shell).

\paragraph{}
There are two main production diagrams of di-Higgs at the LHC, both shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SM_HH}. In the gluon-gluon  fusion process, di-Higgs are produced through a box or a triangle loop. 
Only the triangle loop~\ref{fig:SM_HH_tri} probes the $\lambda_{hhh}$. 
In the triangle diagram, the middle Higgs boson acts as a propagator (off-shell), and the two Higgs bosons in the final state are on-shell. 
The diagram with an on-shell middle Higgs and two off-shell Higgs bosons in the final state is strongly disfavored~\cite{Pdg}.
The box and triangle diagrams interfere destructively, which makes the overall production rate smaller than what would be expected in the absence of a $\lambda_{hhh}$ term.

\paragraph{}
Many other different production modes of di-Higgs exist, but gluon-gluon fusion is the dominant one. Figure~\ref{fig:SM_HH_xsec}~\cite{Frederix:2014hta} compares the cross sections of gluon-gluon fusion, Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)~\ref{fig:SM_HH_VBF}, top-pair, $W^{\pm}$, $Z$ and single-top associated di-Higgs production.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
\label{par:diHiggs-crosssection}
For p-p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ \TeV, the total cross section for SM di-Higgs production~\cite{LHCYellow} is evaluated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) with the summation of logarithms at next-to-next-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy and including finite top-quark mass effects at NLO. 
The uncertainties are from energy scale and parton distributions functions (PDF):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gluon gluon fusion: $\sigma_{gg \to HH} = 33.49^{+ 4.3 \%}_{-6.0 \%} \pm 2.1\%$ fb. %\pm 2.3\%$ $\alpha_s$
  \item Vector boson fusion: $\sigma_{VBF \to HH} = 1.62^{+ 2.3 \%}_{-2.7 \%} \pm 2.3\%$ fb.
  \item Gluon gluon fusion to Triple-Higgs: $\sigma_{gg \to HHH} = 0.06332 ^{+ 16.1 \%}_{-14.1 \%} \pm 3.4\% $ fb.
\end{itemize} 
This means inside 2015 and 2016 ATLAS 36 \ifb data , the SM expectation is around one thousand di-Higgs events and only two triple Higgs events.

\section{Beyond the Standard Model physics di-Higgs production}
\paragraph{}
The SM works extremely well, yet the Higgs boson mass at $125$ \GeV~ requires extreme fine-tuning for radiative corrections. The presence of new physics at the \TeV~ scale would help solve the naturalness problem.

\paragraph{}
BSM physics could significantly enhance the production of di-Higgs at the LHC. This is separated into two categories: non-resonant and resonant production. 
The non-resonant production generally refers to modifications of the Higgs couplings, either the Higgs self-coupling or the Higgs-top couplings. 
Resonant production refers to the case when a particle with mass greater than twice the Higgs mass decays directly into two Higgs bosons. 
The non-resonant and resonant production also differ from the invariant mass distribution of the di-Higgs at the truth level. 
In the non-resonant case, the invariant mass distribution has no clear peak, whereas in the resonant case, the invariant mass distribution usually forms a peak with model dependent width.

\label{fig:BSM_HH}
\end{figure}

\subsection{BSM non-resonant di-Higgs}
\paragraph{}
Enhanced non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is predicted by many models. BSM models featuring direct $t\bar{t}\hh$ vertices \cite{Grober:2010yv, Contino:2012xk} or new light colored scalars \cite{PhysRevD.86.095023} could augment vertice strength, shown as the red dots in Figure~\ref{fig:BSM_HH}. 
A direct modification of the Higgs self-coupling coefficient in Eq~\ref{eqn:higgspotential}, from $\lambda_{\rm sm}hhh$ to $\lambda hhh$, is also possible. This is shown as the green dot in Figure~\ref{fig:BSM_HH_tri}. 

\paragraph{}
The non-resonant di-Higgs enhancement is usually described by the di-Higgs cross section ratio between a BSM $\lambda$ coupling scenario and the $\lambda_{\rm SM}$ coupling scenario.
$\frac{\rm \lambda}{\rm \lambda_{\rm SM}}$ indicates the ratio between the BSM model $\lambda$ and $\lambda_{\rm SM}$.
From the SM electroweak measurements, the self coupling term is constrained to $-14 \leq \frac{\rm \lambda}{\rm \lambda_{\rm SM}} \leq 17.4$~\cite{Kribs:2017znd}. 
Variations of $\lambda$ have a non-trivial effect on di-Higgs production cross section, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SM_HH_lam}~\cite{Frederix:2014hta}. 
In the regime of relatively high trilinear coupling, the observation will be an excess of di-Higgs events with respect to the expected background. 
A simple limit can be set in this case.

The SM values of the cross sections are obtained at $\frac{\rm \lambda}{\rm \lambda_{\rm SM}} = 1$, indicated by the red vertical line. $H$ refers to the SM Higgs.}
  \label{fig:SM_HH_lam}
\end{figure}

\subsection{BSM resonant di-Higgs}
\paragraph{}
Resonant Higgs boson pair production is also predicted by many models. Extensions of the Higgs sector, such as two-Higgs-doublet models(2HDM)~\cite{PhysRevD.8.1226, Branco:2011iw}, propose the existence of a heavy spin-0 scalar $H$ that can decay into di-Higgs. The bulk Randall-Sundrum model~\cite{Agashe:2007zd, Fitzpatrick}, which features spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons, \Grav, could also subsequently decay to pairs of Higgs bosons. These proposed heavy particles, heavy CP-even scalar $H$ and \Grav, are represented as X in Figure~\ref{fig:BSM_HH_X}.

\paragraph{}
The 2HDM is a a simple extension of the SM which has large resonance effects~\cite{LHCYellow}. 
The 2HDM consists of 5 physical Higgs bosons: $h$ (light scalar Higgs), $H$ (heavy scalar Higgs), $A$ (heavy pesudoscalar Higgs), and $H^{\pm}$ (two charged Higgs). 
The 2HDM can introduce tree level favor changing neutral currents. 
To avoid this, models impose discrete symmetries in which the charged fermions only couple to one of the Higgs doublets.
One version is type II 2HDM, in which all positively charged quarks couple to one doublet and the negatively charged quarks and leptons couple to the other. 
The type II model is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model(MSSM)'s Higgs sector.

\paragraph{}
Resonant di-Higgs production in 2HDM models can proceed through decays of the heavy CP-even Higgs $H\to hh$. 
The branching ratio for $H\to hh$ depends on the model type as well as the values of $\tan{\beta}$ and $\cos(\beta - \alpha)$. 
$\tan{\beta} = \frac{\rm \nu_{\rm doublet2}}{\rm \nu_{SM}}$ is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. 
$\alpha$ is the mixing angle between the heavy $H$ and light $h$ fields. 
The limit where $\cos(\beta - \alpha) = 0$ is called the alignment limit, and in this limit the light Higgs $h$ has the same couplings as a SM Higgs. 
Near the alignment limit there is some unprobed phase space depending on the exact models and values of $\tan{\beta}$, and they are particularly interesting to be searched for at the LHC.

\paragraph{}
The Randall-Sundrum model proposes a five-dimensional warped spacetime that contains two manifolds: one where the force of gravity is very strong and a second manifold at the \TeV~ scale corresponding to the known SM sector.
The experimental consequence of this theory is a series of widely mass-spaced Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances, \Grav. 
In cases where the fermions are localized to the SM brane, production of gravitons from fermion pairs is suppressed and the primary mode of production of \Grav is gluon fusion. 
These gravitons further decay to di-Higgs, with branching fraction ranging from $6.43$\% for gravitons with a mass of $500$ \GeV~ to $7.66\%$ at $3$ \TeV.
Randall-Sundrum models have two free parameters - the mass of the graviton and $c = k/\bar{M}_{\rm pl}$, where $\bar{M}_{\rm pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass and $k$ is the curvature scale of the extra dimension. 
The width of the graviton increases with both mass and $c$.

  \caption{Parton luminosity ratios as a function of resonance mass $M_{X}$ for $13/8$ \TeV~\cite{LumiRatio}. $1$, $2$, and $3$ ~\TeV $M_{X}$ ratios are indicated by red lines. For a $2$ \TeV $X$, the luminosity ratio is almost 10.}
  \label{fig:lumi_ratio}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
In model dependent searches, based on fixed assumptions of the resonance particles' branching ratio, other search channels like resonance $VV$ or \ttbar~ are more sensitive compared to di-Higgs ~\cite{Cavaliere:2203605}. In order to constrain more BSM physics phase space, di-Higgs search results need to be interpreted in different baseline models, covering both narrow and wide resonances.

\paragraph{}
%In summary, resonant di-Higgs searches could test many models including extra dimensions and Supersymmetry.
Generally, it is easy theoretically for new heavy resonance particles to interact with the SM through the Higgs as a mediator, resulting in resonance di-Higgs production. 
With the increased center of mass collision energy from $8$ \TeV~ to $13$ \TeV in LHC Run 2, the production cross section for particles with \TeV~ mass grows , as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lumi_ratio}.
In the case of a 2 \TeV $M_X$, the cross section gain is almost a factor of 10. 
Therefore, it was particularly important to focus on resonant searches above \TeV~ region.


\section{Di-Higgs decay and LHC previous search results}
\paragraph{}
Double Higgs decays into other elementary particles in $1.56 \time 10 ^{-22}$s.
Therefore, searching for di-Higgs requires reconstructing the Higgs boson from the decay products.
Di-Higgs decay is a combination of single Higgs decays. The coupling terms to fermions and bosons are shown in Equation~\ref{eqn:higgspotential}. 
The branching ratio of the di-Higgs final state is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HH_BR}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/theory/HH_BR}
  \caption{Summary of di-Higgs final states and their ratios. Top left, \bbbb, has the largest branching ratio.}

The expected limits from individual searches are also shown. The green and yellow bands represent $\pm 1\sigma$ and $\pm 2\sigma$ uncertainty ranges of the expected combined limits. The improvement above $m_{H} =500$ GeV reflects the sensitivity of the \bbbb~ analysis. The results beyond 1 \TeV are only from the \bbbb~ final state alone.}
  \label{fig:Run1_ATLAS}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Previous searches for Higgs boson pair production have not found any significant signals. 
Using 8~\TeV\ data, ATLAS has examined the \bbbb~\cite{Aad:2015uka}, \bbgg~\cite{HIGG-2013-29}, \bbtautau and \WWgg~ channels, all of which were combined ~\cite{Aad:2015xja}. 
The resonant search combination result is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Run1_ATLAS}. 
The best non-resonant $\sigma(pp \to hh)$ cross section limit in Run 1 is the ATLAS combination, at $0.69$ pb. This corresponds to $|\frac{\rm \lambda}{\rm \lambda_{\rm SM}}| <70$. 
Different di-Higgs search challenges and perspectives are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \bbbb~: Trigger limits the low mass resonance searches, but for high mass resonances above 500 \GeV, the branching ratio of this channel provides a decisive advantage. It is great for non-resonant searches as well.
	\item \bbWW: Despite the second largest branching ratio, large background from \ttbar~ limits this search sensitivity.
	\item \bbgg~: This channel benefits from good double photon trigger efficiency, a good photon reconstruction efficiency and a low SM background. Most sensitive at low mass $m_{X} \leq 350$ \GeV. At higher masses, the smaller branching ratio and the merging of photons hurt the search sensitivity. Great for non-resonant searches.
	\item \bbtautau~: An intermediate choice between \bbbb~ and \bbgg~ for resonance searches. Yet this channel contributes to the non-resonant result significantly.
	\item \WWgg~: Suffers from much lower branching ratio and lower reconstruction efficiency of the $W^+W^-$ compared to $b\bar{b}$.
	\item $W^+W^-\tau\tau$, $W^+W^-W^+W^-$, $b\bar{b}ZZ$: There are no search results on these channels yet. But because of the relatively large branching ratio, it is likely that they would be explored in the future.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolved and Boosted}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/theory/resolved_boosted}
  \caption{Cartoon for \Xtohhb, with resolved event topology (left) and boosted event topology (right).}
  \label{fig:resolved_bosted}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
The thesis focuses on searching for a \TeV~ scale resonance \Xtohhb. 
The invariant mass of the two-Higgs-boson-candidate system, \mtwoJ, is used as the final discriminant between Higgs boson pair production and the SM backgrounds.
The Higgs bosons reconstruction affects the \mtwoJ invariant mass resolution.
Fully reconstructed out-coming $b$ quarks are also necessary to separate the signal from the multi quark production backgrounds.

\paragraph{}
When the Higgs bosons have Lorentz low boosts, four small-\R $b$-jets with $R=0.4$ can be reconstructed.
This final state is called the \textit{resolved} state, shown on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:resolved_bosted}.
The resolved strategy is effective for resonance $M_X$ from $260$ \GeV~ up to $1.2$ \TeV.
It is also good for non-resonance di-Higgs searches.

\paragraph{}
A different reconstruction strategy has to be used for di-Higgs systems with higher Lorentz boosts from heavier resonances.
For a Higgs produced with momentum $p_{H}$, the angular separation between the $b$ and $\bar{b}$ quarks, \drbb, scales roughly as $\frac{2m_H}{p_{H}}$. 
For example, a $1.5$ \TeV~ resonance \Grav~ is produced roughly at rest in a $pp$ collision. 
In the lab frame, the two Higgs bosons each get $\sim 625$ \GeV~ momentum. 
The \drbb~ is around $0.4$.
This means that the standard $R=0.4$ $b$-jets cannot resolve the $b\bar{b}$ system.
Therefore a different analysis strategy is required.
Instead, each $b\bar{b}$ system is reconstructed as a single large-radius jet.
The large-radius jet contains the decay products of the Higgs boson.
The presence of $b$-quarks is inferred using smaller-radius track jets built from charged-particle tracks.
This final state is called the \textit{boosted} state, shown on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:resolved_bosted}.
This strategy works for resonance $M_X$ from $1$ \GeV~ up to $3$ \TeV.


\paragraph{}
In summary, di-Higgs has a small production rate in the SM, but could be significantly enhanced in BSM scenarios. In particular, a heavy resonance spin-0 or spin 2 particle could decay into Higgs boson pair directly. The search sensitivity for massive resonances increases as the center of mass energy of the collision increases. For resonance signals above 1 \TeV~ decaying into di-Higgs, \bbbb~ channel has the best discovery potential in Run 2. In order to fully reconstruct these \Xtohhb, boosted techniques has to be used. Therefore, searching for \TeV~ scale resonance production of di-Higgs $\to$ \bbbb~ using the boosted analysis is the goal of thesis.
% In LHC Run 2, in the \bbbb~channel, ATLAS searched for both non-resonant and resonant production in the mass range of 400--3000~\GeV\ using 3.2 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of 13~\TeV\ data~\cite{EXOT-2015-11} collected during 2015.
