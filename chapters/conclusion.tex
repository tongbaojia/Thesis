\paragraph{}
Di-Higgs search has a short history, but will have a long future ahead. 
This thesis presents a search for both resonant and non-resonant production of pairs of Standard Model Higgs bosons has been carried out in the dominant \bbbb~ channel, using $36.1$ \ifb\ of LHC $pp$ collision data at $\rts = 13$~\TeV\ collected by ATLAS in 2015 and 2016. 
The search sensitivity of this analysis exceeds that of the previous analysis of the $\rts = 13\,\TeV$ 2015 dataset~\cite{Aaboud:2016xco} for non-resonant signal and also across the entire mass range of $260$ to $3000$ \GeV~ for the resonance search, with significantly improvement in the high mass resonance sensitivities. 
The resolved analysis has each $h \to b\bar{b}$ reconstructed as two separate $b$-tagged jets, and the boosted analysis has each $h \to b\bar{b}$ reconstructed as a single large-radius jet associated with at least one small-radius $b$-tagged track-jet. 
The estimated background consists mainly of multi-jet and \ttbar\ events.

\paragraph{}
No significant excess is observed in the data. 
%The largest deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed for narrow signal models at a mass of 280~\GeV\ in the resolved analysis, with a global significance of 2.3$\sigma$. This excess could be a trigger-turn on combined with kinematic selection effect and might not last with more data. 
Upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio to the \bbbb~ final state are set for a narrow-width spin-0 scalar and for wider spin-2 resonances. 
The bulk RS model with $\kMPl = 1$ is excluded for masses between $313$ and $1362$ \GeV, and the bulk RS model with $\kMPl = 2$ is excluded for masses below $1744$ \GeV.
The $95\%$ CL upper limit on the non-resonant production is $147$~fb, which corresponds to $13.0$ times the SM expectation.

\paragraph{}
This result confirms the great success of the Standard Model.
The Higgs potential shape couldn't be very different from the SM predictions at \TeV energy scale.
Without any significant excess, the phase space for Beyond the Standard Model physics is further constrained.

\paragraph{}
Improvement with future Run 2 data could come $b$-tagging, especially efficiency increase in high \pt region. 
Other aspects include advanced trigger technologies, which can increase the signal event rate, and improved jet energy and mass resolution, which can increase the purity in selection.
Together with the larger dataset, it is possible to double the current resonance search sensitivity. 
For non-resonance search, combined $|\frac{\rm\lambda}{\rm\lambda_{SM}}| \sim 10$ is possible at the end of Run 2 in 2020.

\paragraph{}
For longer perspectives, di-Higgs searches and measurements will continue to be one of the most important analysis. 
It can show hints of the physics Beyond the Standard Model. 
In 2030 to 2040, the High Luminosity LHC will be able to constrain $|\frac{\rm\lambda}{\rm\lambda_{SM}}| \sim 1$ with all the different channels from both ATLAS and CMS combined. 

\paragraph{}
For even longer future developments in high energy experiments, all aspects--accelerator, detector, computation and theory--must advance together to answer the questions the Standard Model cannot answer, or find questions the Standard Model didn't ask~\cite{Richter:2014pga, Hawking:2018tcn}. 
Life is short for mankind, and the understanding of the universe is an endless journey. 
I am deeply honored to be a small part of this odyssey by working on the boosted \pptofourb~ analysis.
