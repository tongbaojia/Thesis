\subsection{Data}

\paragraph{}
This analysis is performed on two LHC $pp$ collision datasets at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~\TeV~ recorded by the ATLAS experiment. Data were collected during stable beam conditions and when all relevant detector systems were functional. A Good Run List (GRL) is generated after gathering online and offline data quality reviews of the dataset after reconstruction. Typically, any $> 10\%$ defect in any detector subsystem makes the corresponding Lumibloks (LB) fail the GRL requirement. The integrated luminosity of the 2015 dataset passing the GRL is 3.2~\ifb, and the 2016 dataset passing a different GRL is 32.9~\ifb. These values are about $82\%$ and $92\%$ of the data ATLAS recorded, in Figure~\ref{fig:Lumi}.


\paragraph{}
In the resolved analysis, a combination of $b$-jet triggers is used. Events were required to feature either one $b$-tagged jet~\cite{btaggingRun2, Aad:2015ydr} with transverse momentum \pt$>225$~\GeV, or two $b$-tagged jets, either both satisfying \pt$>35$~\GeV\ or both satisfying \pt$>55$~\GeV, with different requirements on the $b$-tagging. Some triggers required additional non-$b$-tagged jets. Due to a change in the online $b$-tagging algorithm between 2015 and 2016, the two datasets are treated independently until they are combined in the final statistical analysis. After the selection described in Section~\ref{sec:resolved}, this combination of triggers is estimated to be 65\% efficient for simulated signals with a Higgs boson pair invariant mass, $m_{HH}$, of 280~\GeV, rising to 100\% efficiency for resonance masses greater than 600~\GeV. During 2016 data-taking, a fraction of the data was affected by an inefficiency in the online vertex reconstruction, which reduced the efficiency of the algorithms used to identify $b$-jets; those events were not retained for further analysis. This reduces the integrated luminosity of the 2016 dataset for the resolved analysis to 24.3 \ifb.

\paragraph{}
In the boosted analysis, events were selected from the 2015 dataset using a trigger that required a single anti-$k_t$ jet~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with radius parameter $R=1.0$ and with \pt$> 360$~\GeV. In 2016, a similar trigger was used but with a higher threshold of \pt$> 420$~\GeV. The efficiency of these triggers is 100\% for simulated signals passing the jet requirements described in Section~\ref{sec:boosted}, so the 2015 and 2016 datasets were combined into one dataset.
