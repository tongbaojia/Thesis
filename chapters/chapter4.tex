\chapter{Game of Jigsaw--Reconstruction}

\section{Introduction to objects}

\paragraph{}
Leptons are rare in proton-proton collisions. Less than $1\%$ of the total tracks are made from leptons, and these are often related to very interesting physics processes, especially invovling the electroweak forces.

\paragraph{}
Electrons are maximal inoizing in the tracking system. They get absorbed completely in ECAL nd leaves no signature in the HCAL.

\paragraph{}
Muons are special for leaving minimally ionizing signatures in the detector. They usually penetrate the calorimeter and form tracks in the Muon Spetrometer. This is useful for reducing the generate rate of events, hence for triggering. They are also very clean in reconstruction and have exceelnt resolutions up to 1 TeV.
