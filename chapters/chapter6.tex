% To improve the analysis, a quantity which defines the sensitivity of analysis is maximized. Techicially, the optimal sensitivity is described as $\sqrt{2((S+B)\ln{1 + \frac{S}{B}} - S}$, see \href{https://www.pp.rhul.ac.uk/~cowan/stat/notes/SigCalcNote.pdf}{note}. This is usually considered at the $S << B$ limit and simplified as $\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}$, when no knowledge of the model cross section is available, or $\frac{S}{\sqrt{S + B}}$, if the signal cross section is known. These parametrizations have limitations, particularly when the signal yield and the number of estiamted background are both small. A better parametrization for low signal strengh is $\frac{S}{\sqrt{1 + B}}$, where the extra $\sqrt{1 + B}$ accounts for poisson fluctuations. For a discussion of p-values, please see this \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0208005.pdf}{note}.

% For this analysis, two methods are used: one is calculate the number of signal and backgrounds within $68\%$ of the signal \mhh mass window, the other is to implement the full signal and background predicions after smoothing and compare the asymptotic expected exclusion limits. Both methods yield comparable results.
