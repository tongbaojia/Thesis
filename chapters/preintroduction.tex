Naive ambition dies easily.

%I understand perfectly that this is supposed to be a thesis and a formal piece of writing. However, I wish, that unlike the other hundres of thesis produced by graduate students every year, once a while a younger physics student, or someone remotely interested in physics, could pick up my thesis and enjoy reading the stories. So all of the chapters will be devided into a formal part and an informal part. In the formal part, it will be as accurate as possible, describing the physical objects, methods, results and interpretations; in the informal part, the reader will find discussions, intuitions, stories, and my personal feelings. I hope you like reading my thesis, and find it to be not only a scientific document but also a piece of shitty art.
