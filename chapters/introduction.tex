Why do we look for $hh\to 4b$?

\paragraph{}
There are two types of analysis in particle physics. The first one is measurement, which yeilds a observable with an uncertainty. This could either imrpove our knowledge of the Standard Model, or show some inconsistency with the Standard Model. The other type is search, which generally assumes some new physics model and try to justfy in data wether the new model is justified in some observables. A successful search turns the subject into a measurement, yet a null result will set a new limit for a given physics model.
