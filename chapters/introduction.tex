It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way. In short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\paragraph{}
In 2012, the Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiment at the LHC. The particle physics community faces a period just like at the beginning of \textit{A Tale of Two Cities}. 
After Run 1 of the LHC, with the existence of the Higgs now firmly established, the focus shifted to searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. 
In particular, searches for high mass resonances benefit from the LHC's increase in collision energy.  
The newly discovered Higgs can be used as a tool in these searches.
Higgs pair production in the Standard Model has a low cross section that requires large datasets for full measurement. 
However, new physics can modify this cross section, especially through new resonances which decay to two Higgs bosons.
The cross section for a generic gluon-initiated resonance with a mass of $2 \TeV$ increases tenfold in Run 2, making searches for high mass resonances a high priority.

\paragraph{}
The analyses exploit the dominant \hbb~ decay mode to search for Higgs boson pair production in both resonant and non-resonant production. 
The ``resolved'' analysis is used for \hh systems in which the Higgs bosons have Lorentz boosts low enough that four $b$-jets can be reconstructed. 
The ``boosted'' analysis is used for those \hh systems in which the Higgs bosons have higher Lorentz boosts, which prevents the Higgs boson decay products from being resolved in the detector as separate \bjets. 
Instead, each Higgs boson candidate consists of a single large-radius jet, and $b$-decays are identified using smaller-radius jets built from charged-particle tracks.
Two analyses are complementary in their acceptance, each employing a unique technique to reconstruct the Higgs boson.
This thesis focuses on the boosted analysis due to its great sensitivity for heavy resonance signals.

\paragraph{}
Both analyses were re-optimized with respect to the former ATLAS publication~\cite{EXOT-2015-11}; an improved algorithm to pair $b$-jets to Higgs boson candidates is used in the resolved analysis, and in the boosted analysis an additional signal-enriched sample is utilized. 
The dataset comprises the 2015 and 2016 data, corresponding to 27.5 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for the resolved analysis and 36.1 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for the boosted analysis, with the difference due to the trigger selections used. 
The results are obtained using the resolved analysis for a resonance mass between 260 and 1400~\GeV, and the boosted analysis between 800~\GeV\ and 3000~\GeV. 
The main background is multijet production, which is estimated from data; the sub-leading background is \ttbar, which is estimated using both data and simulations. 
The two analyses employ orthogonal selections, and a statistical combination is performed in the mass range where they overlap. 
The final discriminants are the four-jet and dijet mass distributions in the resolved and boosted analyses, respectively. 
Searches are performed for the following benchmark signals: a spin-2 graviton decaying into Higgs bosons, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and SM non-resonant Higgs boson pair production.

\paragraph{}
This dissertation begins by discussing the status of di-Higgs. 
Chapter 1 gives an overview of double Higgs production in the Standard Model and beyond. 
Chapter 2 presents details regarding the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment. 
Chapter 3 discusses reconstruction of physics objects. 
Chapter 4 lists the dataset and simulation samples. 
Chapter 5 shows the event selection.
Chapter 6 discusses the background estimation in details.
Chapter 7 presents the systematics.
Finally, the results are shown in Chapter 8.
A brief summary and outlook is presented in the conclusion.
Many detailed plots and supporting material are shown in the appendices, to keep the main chapters short and readable.


% There are two types of analysis in particle physics. The first one is measurement, which yields a observable with an uncertainty. 
% This could either improve our current knowledge, or show some inconsistency. 
% The other type is search, which generally assumes some new physics model and try to justify in data wether the new model is justified in some observables. 
% A successful search turns the subject into a measurement, yet a null search result will set a new limit for a given physics model.
