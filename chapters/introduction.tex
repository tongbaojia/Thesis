It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way. In short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\paragraph{}
In 2012, the Higgs boson was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiment at the LHC. 
The particle physics community faced a period just like at the beginning of \textit{A Tale of Two Cities}. 
It was the best of times, as the Standard Model was a great success.
It was the worst of times, as there were very few experimental clues for physics beyond the Standard Model.
But with the LHC's increase in collision energy, it is a great time to search for beyond the Standard Model physics.
The newly discovered Higgs boson can be used as a tool in these searches.
Higgs pair production is particularly interesting.
It has a low cross section in the Standard Model.
However, new physics can modify its production process. 
Especially, two Higgs bosons can be produced through heavy resonances particles.
This gives a clear signature at the collider experiments.

\paragraph{}
This search focuses on the dominant \hbb~ decay mode to search for Higgs boson pair production. 
The ``resolved'' analysis is used for \hh systems in which the Higgs bosons have Lorentz boosts low enough that four $b$-jets can be reconstructed. 
The ``boosted'' analysis is used for those \hh systems in which the Higgs bosons have higher Lorentz boosts, which prevents the Higgs boson decay products from being resolved in the detector as separate \bjets. 
Instead, each Higgs boson candidate consists of a single large-radius jet, and $b$-decays are identified using smaller-radius jets built from charged-particle tracks.
Two analyses are complementary in their acceptance, each employing a unique technique to reconstruct the Higgs boson.
This thesis focuses on the boosted analysis due to its great sensitivity for heavy resonance signals.

\paragraph{}
In the boosted analysis, an additional signal-enriched sample is utilized with respect to the former ATLAS publication~\cite{EXOT-2015-11}. 
The dataset comprises the 2015 and 2016 data, corresponding to $36.1$ $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ for the boosted analysis. 
The results are obtained using the resolved analysis for a resonance mass between $260$~\GeV\ and $1400$~\GeV, and the boosted analysis between $800$~\GeV\ and $3000$~\GeV. 
The main background is multijet production, which is estimated from data; the sub-leading background is \ttbar, which is estimated using both data and simulations. 
The two analyses employ orthogonal selections, and a statistical combination is performed in the mass range where they overlap. 
The final discriminants are the four-jet and dijet invariant mass distributions in the resolved and boosted analyses, respectively. 
Limits are set for the following benchmark signals: a spin-2 graviton decaying into Higgs bosons, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and SM non-resonant Higgs boson pair production.

\paragraph{}
This dissertation begins by discussing the status of di-Higgs. 
Chapter 1 gives an overview of double Higgs production in the Standard Model and beyond. 
Chapter 2 presents details regarding the Large Hadron Collider and the ATLAS experiment. 
Chapter 3 discusses reconstruction of physics objects. 
Chapter 4 lists the dataset and simulation samples. 
Chapter 5 shows the event selection.
Chapter 6 discusses the background estimation in details.
Chapter 7 presents the systematics.
Finally, the results are shown in Chapter 8.
A brief summary and outlook is presented in the conclusion.
Many detailed plots and supporting material are shown in the appendices, to keep the main chapters concise.


% There are two types of analysis in particle physics. The first one is measurement, which yields a observable with an uncertainty. 
% This could either improve our current knowledge, or show some inconsistency. 
% The other type is search, which generally assumes some new physics model and try to justify in data wether the new model is justified in some observables. 
% A successful search turns the subject into a measurement, yet a null search result will set a new limit for a given physics model.
