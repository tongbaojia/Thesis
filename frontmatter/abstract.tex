This thesis presents a search for Higgs boson pair production, with the \bbbb~ final state. 
This analysis uses the full 2015 and 2016 data collected collected by the ATLAS Collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, corresponding to $3.2 \pm 0.2$\,\ifb\ of 2015 and $32.9 \pm 1.1$\, \ifb\ of 2016 $pp$ collision data.
Improvements with respect to the previous analysis come from the increased dataset, detailed background estimation and addtional signal regions. 
Search sensitivity is specially enhanced for the resonance signals between $2500$ \GeV and $3000$ \GeV.
The data is found to be compatible with the Standard model, and no signs of new physics have been observed.
The results are interpreted in the context of the bulk Randall-Sundrum warped extra dimension model with a Kaluza-Klein graviton decaying to $hh$, with the coupling $k/\bar{M}_{\rm Pl} = 1.0$ or $2.0$.
The results are also interpreted with the Type 2 two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) where the neutral heavy CP-even $H$ scalar decays to $hh$.
