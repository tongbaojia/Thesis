We present a search for Higgs boson pair production, with two $b\bar{b}$ pairs in the final state. This analysis uses the full 2015 and 2016 data collected collected by the ATLAS Collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, corresponding to $X \pm y$\,\ifb\ of 2015 and $A \pm B$\, \ifb\ of 2016 $pp$ collision data. The data are interpreted in the context of the bulk Randall-Sundrum warped extra dimension model with a Kaluza-Klein graviton decaying to $hh$. %The coupling $k/\bar{M}_{\rm Pl}$, %corresponding to the AdS curvature scale relative to the Planck scale, is chosen to be in the allowed range $1.0 - 2.0$. %Second, the Type 2 two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is used with the neutral heavy CP-even $H$ scalar decays to $hh$.  
Relative to the 2015 analysis, this analysis focuses on improvements in the boosted analysis in the highest resonance mass range (between 2000 GeV and 3000 GeV). The data is found to be compatible with the Standard model, and no signs of new physics have been observed.
