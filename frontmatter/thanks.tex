\paragraph{}
I have many people to thank for. Without them I would not have finished this thesis and my Ph.D. in physics. Thanks to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \newthought{Melissa Franklin}, the best adviser ever. Every time I get stuck, Melissa is always there to guide me and show me the lights at the end of the tunnel. She always pushes me to understand the details I ignore and think about every result I get. Her encouragements, advices and comments have always been inspirational and keep me moving ahead.
	\item \newthought{Masahiro Morii}, for being on my committee, and offering guidance and discussions on physics. You have always been insightful
	\item \newthought{Howard Georgi}, for being on my committee, and having me teaching physics 16 with you.
	\item \newthought{Jo\~{a}o Guimar\~{a}es da Costa}, for your enthusiasm about physics. I have always enjoyed talking about LHC physics with you. You get me interested in di-Higgs and are always very supportive.
	\item \newthought{Paolo Giromini}. You taught me how to work on Micromegas and always have great comments and asking for the White Rabbits.
	\item \newthought{John Huth}, for all your support and great stories.

	\item \newthought{The Chinese, the U.S., and the E.U. governments}. Without their generous supports, I couldn't study and live in different countries.
	\item \newthought{CERN}. CERN is a unique and special place with the streets named after physicists. Without the support from the IT department, I could not log into lxplus, check the twikis and finish my work. CERN user's office also makes traveling to Europe a much nicer and easier experience for me.
	\item \newthought{LHC}. Without a fully functional accelerator, there would have been no data for me to study. The LHC performed outstandingly since 2015, and all the valuable data in this thesis is produced from it. 
	\item \newthought{Everyone in the ATLAS collaboration}. They have supported this remarkable program and have contributed enormously to my thesis. Without the excellent work on detector design, commissioning, operational works, reconstruction, data processing, performance studies and recommendations, software support, computing support, and analysis discussions and guidance, I could not have completed this thesis. I sincerely thank all ATLAS members for their work.
	\item \newthought{ATLAS Muon experts}. Thanks to Christoph Amelung for his support. Thanks to Ioannis Nomidis, for his guidance on Athena and Muon Monitoring Software. Thanks to Philipp Fleischmann and TieSheng Dai for teaching me about ATLAS control room and Muon detectors, and bringing me down to the detector. Thanks to Niels Van Eldik, for his guidance on Hough Transform, Segment reconstruction and seeding. Thanks to Jochen Meyer, for his patience, help and discussions on Muon reconstruction and software writing.
	\item \newthought{ATLAS di-Higgs to 4b group}. Thanks to Mel Shochet for his support. Thanks to Michael Kagan, for his guidance, patience and pushing. Thanks to John Allison, for always doing great works. Thanks to David Wardrope, for his help on statistical analysis. Thanks to Jana Schaarschmidt, for finishing the paper. Thanks to Qi Zeng, for the his help and useful discussions. Thanks to Patrick Bryant, for finishing the resolved di-Higgs analysis. Without them I would not have completed the di-Higgs analysis.
	\item \newthought{Harvard ATLAS group postdocs}. I want to thank Alex Tuna, for his patience, help and kind support in the Muon work and di-Higgs analysis. I want to thank Pierluigi Catastini, for working on early di-Higgs search with me over 2014 summer; Hugh Skottowe, for his help on Micromegas and codes; Geraldine Conti; David Lopez Mateos, for his discussions on physics; Chris Rogan, for his passion and great inishgts in analysis; Valerio Ippolito, for following up on questions; Stefano Zambito and Larry Lee, for their discussions and help.
	\item \newthought{Harvard ATLAS graduate students}. Thanks to my friend, Stephen Chan, for his great company and awesome-o help. Thanks to Tomo Lazovich and Emma Tolley for being great elder graduate students. Thanks to Karri Di Petrillo and Ann Wang for great discussions and supports. I want to also thank Laura Jeanty, Giovanni Zevi Della Porta, Kevin Mercurio, William Spearman, Andy Yen, Brian Clark, Siyuan Sun, Jennifer Roloff, and Julia Gonski.
	\item \newthought{Harvard ATLAS undergraduate students}. I want to thank Michael Albergo and Gray Putnam, the two undergraduates I have worked with.
	\item \newthought{Harvard physics staff}. I want to thank Lisa Cacciabaudo, Carol Davis, Jacob Barandes, Korin Watras, and Angela Allen for always having open doors and being the most kind, helpful people in the Physics department. 
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\item \newthought{Caltech and my undergraduate advisers}. Dr. Thomas Tombrello, thanks for teaching me to do research. Stephen Padin, thanks for teaching me how to do an experiment in a lab. Gil Rafeal, thanks for being a great a friend and offering me great discussions. Harvey Newman, thanks for teaching me EM and special relativity, and all the help on my research. And Maria Spiropulu, thanks for show me how exciting particle physics is. I also want to thank Yi Chen, who taught me a lot when I was a junior on CMS.
	\item \newthought{Chi Feng, Helena Zhang, Peter Koch, Jennifer Hu}. Thanks for being my wonderful friends from Caltech.
	\item \newthought{Xinyu Yang, Chi Zhang, Rundong Ning, Boqi Zhu, Yizhou Jin}. Thanks for being my wonderful friends from Beijing High School Four.
	\item \newthought{Weidong Tong}, my father. You have always been the smartest person I know, and you will always be.
	\item \newthought{Liping Sun}, my mother. You have always been the wisest person I know, and you will always be.
	\item \newthought{Xuyang Ma}. I didn't find a new particle, but I found you.
