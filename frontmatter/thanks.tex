%\newthought{Thank you Melissa Franklin}, the best adivsor ever. It was five years ago when I made the decision, that of all the schools I visited, Melissa is the only one that will make my life "suffer" the most for the next five years. And I think it is safe to say that I was still right. This is probably one of the hardest paths I could foresee, yet at every corner, Melissa is there to guide me and show me the lights at the end of the tunnel. She is always pushing me to understand the details I ignore, and think about every action I make in analysis or operations. Her encouragements, or complains about my progress, have always been insparational and keep me moving ahead. There have been multiple nights when I was worried about work, and after talking to her, I always felt much more confident. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa.

%\newthought{Thanks to my friend, Stephen--I don't know how to pronaunce his middle name--Chan}, for his great acompany and help. Dr. Chan has been extermely awesome-o.

\newthought{Thanks to everyone the ATLAS collaboration}, who has supported this remarkable program and has contributed to every bit of the result in my thesis. Sir Issac Newton said he was standing on the gaint's showlders to see far and deep into the nature. Similarly. I am standing on the ATLAS(member)'s showlders--it's eight stories high so I hope ATLAS doesn't shrug. Without the excellent work on detector design, commisioning, operational works, reconstruction, data processing, performance studies and recommendations, software support, computing support, and analysis discussions and guidance, I could not have completed this thesis. I truely and sincerely thank all ATLAS members for their contributions.

% \newthought{Thanks to Ioannis Nomidis, for his guidance on Athena and Muon Monitoring Software. Thanks to Philipp Fleischmann and Tie Sheng for teaching me about ATLAS control room and Muon detectors, and bringing me down to the detector. Without them I would not complete my muon data quality work.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Niels Van Eldik, for his guidance on Hough Transform, Segment reconstruction and seeding. Thanks to Jochen Meyer, for his patience, help and discussions on Muon reconstruction and software writing. Without them I would not complete my muon recionstruction work.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Michael Kagan. Thanks to John Allison. Thanks to David Wardrope. Thanks to Jana Schaarschmidt. Thanks to Qi Zeng. Thanks to Patrick Bryant. Without them I would not complete di-Higgg analysis.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Harvard ATLAS group. Everyone I know is a great person. }

%\newthought{Thank you my father Weidong Tong}, who has always been the greatest insparation for me. He has always been the smartest person I know, and he will always be.

%\newthought{Thank you my mother Liping Sun}, who has always been the greatest understanding for me. She has always been the wisest person I know, and she will always be.
