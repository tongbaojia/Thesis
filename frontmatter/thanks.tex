%\newthought{Thank you Melissa Franklin}, the best adviser ever. It was five years ago when I made the decision, that of all the schools I visited, Melissa is the only one that will make my life "suffer" the most for the next five years. And I think it is safe to say that I was still right. This is probably one of the hardest paths I could foresee, yet at every corner, Melissa is there to guide me and show me the lights at the end of the tunnel. She is always pushing me to understand the details I ignore, and think about every action I make in analysis or operations. Her encouragements, or complains about my progress, have always been inspirational and keep me moving ahead. There have been multiple nights when I was worried about work, and after talking to her, I always felt much more confident. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. This thesis is apparently a piece of shit.

%\newthought{Thank you Masahiro Morii}.

%\newthought{Thank you Howard Georgi}. I really enjoyed teaching Physics 16 with you.

%\newthought{Thank you John Huth}.

%\newthought{Thank you Paolo Giromini}.

%\newthought{Thank you Jo\~{a}o Guimar\~{a}es da Costa}. I have always enjoyed talking about LHC physics with him. Thanks for getting me started on di-Higgs, and always be supportive.

\newthought{Thanks to everyone working at CERN}. CERN is a unique and special place. I love how the streets are named by physicists. Without the support from the IT department, I could not log into lxplus, check the twikis and finish my work. CERN user's office also made traveling to Europe a much nicer and easier experience for me. 

\newthought{Thanks to everyone working on the Large Hadron Collider}. Without a fully functional accelerator, there would have been no data for me to study. The LHC performed outstandingly since 2015, and all the valuable data in this thesis is produced from it. 

\newthought{Thanks to everyone the ATLAS collaboration}, who has supported this remarkable program and has contributed to every bit of the result in my thesis. I am standing on the ATLAS(member)'s shoulders--eight floors high and don't shrug. Without the excellent work on detector design, commissioning, operational works, reconstruction, data processing, performance studies and recommendations, software support, computing support, and analysis discussions and guidance, I could not have completed this thesis. I sincerely thank all ATLAS members for their work.

% \newthought{Thanks to Ioannis Nomidis, for his guidance on Athena and Muon Monitoring Software. Thanks to Philipp Fleischmann and TieSheng Dai for teaching me about ATLAS control room and Muon detectors, and bringing me down to the detector. Without them I would not complete my muon data quality work.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Niels Van Eldik, for his guidance on Hough Transform, Segment reconstruction and seeding. Thanks to Jochen Meyer, for his patience, help and discussions on Muon reconstruction and software writing. Without them I would not complete my muon reconstruction work.}

% \newthought{Thanks to the ATLAS di-Higgs to \bbbb group}. Thanks to Michael Kagan, for his guidance, patience and pushing. Thanks to John Allison, for always doing great works. Thanks to David Wardrope, for his help on statistical analysis. Thanks to Jana Schaarschmidt, for finishing the paper. Thanks to Qi Zeng, for the his help and useful discussions. Thanks to Patrick Bryant, for finishing the resolved di-Higgs analysis. Without them I would not complete di-Higgs analysis.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Harvard ATLAS group.} Everyone I know is a great person.  
%For the postdocs, I want to thank Pierluigi Catastini, for working on early di-Higgs search with me over 2014 summer; Hugh Skottowe, for his help on Micromegas and codes; Geraldine Conti; David Lopez Mateos, for his discussions on physics; Chris Rogan, for his passion and great inishgts in analysis; Valerio Ippolito, for following up on questions; Stefano Zambito, Alex Tuna and Larry Lee.

%\newthought{Thanks to my friend, Stephen Chan}, for his great company and awesome-o help.

%For the graduate students, I want to thank Laura Jeanty, Giovanni Zevi Della Porta, Kevin Mercurio, William Spearman, Andy Yen, Brian Clark, Tomo Lazovich, Emma Tolley, Siyuan Sun, Karri Di Petrillo, Jennifer Roloff, Julia Gonski, and Ann Wang.

%For the undergraduate students, I want to thank Michael Albergo and Gray Putnam, the two undergraduates I have worked with as a graduate student.

%For the staff, I want to thank Lisa Cacciabaudo, Carol Davis, Jacob Barandes, Korin Watras, and Angela Allen for always having open doors and being the most kind, helpful people in the Physics department. 

%\newthought{Thanks to Caltech and my undergraduate advisers}. Dr. Thomas Tombrello, thanks for teaching me to do research. Stephen Padin, thanks for teaching me how to do an experiment in a lab. Gil Rafeal, thanks for being a great a friend and offering me great discussions. Harvey Newman, thanks for teaching me EM and special relativity, and all the help on my research. And Maria Spiropulu, thanks for show me how exciting particle physics is. I also want to thank Yi Chen and Christopher Rogan, who taught me a lot when I was a junior on CMS.

%\newthought{Thanks to the Chinese, the U.S., and the E.U. governments}. Without their generous supports, I couldn't study and live in a different country. I am extremely lucky to have a peaceful life so far.

%\newthought{Thank you my father Weidong Tong}, who has always been the greatest inspiration for me. He has always been the smartest person I know, and he will always be.

%\newthought{Thank you my mother Liping Sun}, who has always been the greatest understanding for me. She has always been the wisest person I know, and she will always be.

%\newthought{Thank you Xuyang Ma}. I didn't find a new particle, but I found love.
