%\newthought{Thank you Melissa Franklin}, the best adivsor ever. It was five years ago when I made the decision, that of all the schools I visited, Melissa is the only one that will make my life "suffer" the most for the next five years. And I think it is safe to say that I was still right. This is probably one of the hardest paths I could foresee, yet at every corner, Melissa is there to guide me and show me the lights at the end of the tunnel. She is always pushing me to understand the details I ignore, and think about every action I make in analysis or operations. Her encouragements, or complains about my progress, have always been insparational and keep me moving ahead. There have been multiple nights when I was worried about work, and after talking to her, I always felt much more confident. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa.

%\newthought{Thanks to my friend, Stephen--I don't know how to pronaunce his middle name--Chan}, for his great acompany and help. Dr. Chan has been extermely awesome-o.


%\newthought{Thanks to Jochen Meyer. Thanks to his patience, help and discussions on Muon reconstruction and software writing. He is a great guy.}

\newthought{Thanks to everyone in the ATLAS collaboration}, who have supported this remarkable program and have contributed to every bit of the result in my thesis. Sir Issac Newton said he was standing on the gaint's showlders, and I am standing on the ATLAS(member)'s showlders. It's eight stories high so I hope it doesn't shrug. Without their work on detector design, commisioning, operational works, reconstruction, data processing, performance studies and recommendations, software support, computing support, and analysis discussions and guidance, I could not have completed this work. I truely and sincerely thank everyone deeply for their contributions.

%\newthought{Thank you my father Weidong Tong}, who has always been the greatest insparation for me. He has always been the smartest person I know, and he will always be.

%\newthought{Thank you my mother Liping Sun}, who has always been the greatest understanding for me. She has always been the wisest person I know, and she will always be.
