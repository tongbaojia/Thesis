%\newthought{Thank you Melissa Franklin}, the best adivsor ever. It was five years ago when I made the decision, that of all the schools I visited, Melissa is the only one that will make my life "suffer" the most for the next five years. And I think it is safe to say that I was still right. This is probably one of the hardest paths I could foresee, yet at every corner, Melissa is there to guide me and show me the lights at the end of the tunnel. She is always pushing me to understand the details I ignore, and think about every action I make in analysis or operations. Her encouragements, or complains about my progress, have always been insparational and keep me moving ahead. There have been multiple nights when I was worried about work, and after talking to her, I always felt much more confident. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, Melissa. This thesis is apparently a piece of shit.

\newthought{Thanks to everyone working at CERN}. CERN is a truely unique and special place. I love how the streets are named by physicists. Without the support from the IT department, I could not log into lxplus, check the twikis and finish my work. CERN user's office also made traveling to Europe a much nicer and easier experience for me. 

\newthought{Thanks to everyone working on the Large Hadron Collider}. Without a fully functional accerator, there would have been no data for me to study. The LHC performed outstandingly since 2015, and all the valuable data is produced from it. 

\newthought{Thanks to everyone the ATLAS collaboration}, who has supported this remarkable program and has contributed to every bit of the result in my thesis. Sir Issac Newton said he was standing on the gaint's showlders to see far and deep into the nature. Similarly. I am standing on the ATLAS(member)'s showlders--it's eight stories high so I hope ATLAS doesn't shrug. Without the excellent work on detector design, commisioning, operational works, reconstruction, data processing, performance studies and recommendations, software support, computing support, and analysis discussions and guidance, I could not have completed this thesis. I truely and sincerely thank all ATLAS members for their contributions.

% \newthought{Thanks to Ioannis Nomidis, for his guidance on Athena and Muon Monitoring Software. Thanks to Philipp Fleischmann and Tie Sheng for teaching me about ATLAS control room and Muon detectors, and bringing me down to the detector. Without them I would not complete my muon data quality work.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Niels Van Eldik, for his guidance on Hough Transform, Segment reconstruction and seeding. Thanks to Jochen Meyer, for his patience, help and discussions on Muon reconstruction and software writing. Without them I would not complete my muon recionstruction work.}

% \newthought{On the analysis side, I learned and got help from multiple people. Thanks to Michael Kagan, for his patience and pushing. Thanks to John Allison, for doing great works. Thanks to David Wardrope. Thanks to Jana Schaarschmidt. Thanks to Qi Zeng. Thanks to Patrick Bryant. Without them I would not complete di-Higgg analysis.}

% \newthought{Thanks to Harvard ATLAS group. Everyone I know is a great person. } 
%For the postdocs, I want to thank Pierluigi Catastini, Hugh Skottowe, Geraldine Conti, David Lopez Mateos, Chris Rogan, Valerio Ippolito, Stefano Zambito, Alex Tuna and Larry Lee. 
%\newthought{Thanks to my friend, Stephen Chan}, for his great acompany and help. Dr. Chan has been extermely awesome-o.
%For the graduate students, I want to thank Laura Jeanty, Giovanni Zevi Della Porta, Kevin Mercurio, William Spearman, Andy Yen, Brian Clark, Tomo Lazovich, Emma Tolley, Siyuan Sun, Stephen Chan, Karri Di Petrillo, Jennifer Roloff, Julia Gonski, and Ann Wang.
%For the undergraduate students, I want to thank Michael Albergo and Gray Putnam, the two undergraduates I have worked with as a graduate student.
%For the staff, I want to thank Lisa Cacciabaudo, Carol Davis, Jacob Barandes, Korin Watras, and Angela Allen for always having open doors and being the most kind, helpful people in the Physics department. 


%\newthought{Thank you my father Weidong Tong}, who has always been the greatest insparation for me. He has always been the smartest person I know, and he will always be.

%\newthought{Thank you my mother Liping Sun}, who has always been the greatest understanding for me. She has always been the wisest person I know, and she will always be.
